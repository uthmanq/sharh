      "commentary": "The purpose of this preliminary is to establish a paradigm through which the rest of the Divine Law can be understood. This preliminary has ties to every science. All knowledge of creations , secular and religious, can be divided into two categories: concepts and propositions made out of those concepts. For example, “human” is a concept. “Humans have bodies” is a proposition. A proposition and a judgement are synonyms.  The reason a proposition is called a judgement is because you are judging the subject of the proposition by the predicate. You are judging, or affirming, “humans” to have bodies. Likewise, I can judge through negation, such as saying “the universe did not create itself”. All of our knowledge is divided in this way. Out of these, Imam Al-Sanusi mentions three of the types of propositions that are used in the majority of discussions related to Aqida, Usul-ul-Fiqh, and Fiqh. ",
